			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src="https://plarison.github.io/portfolio/assets/images/mugshot.jpg" alt="A picture of Paul" style="float:left;width:150px;height:200px;padding:20px;">
			<p>Hello, I'm Paul Larison. I recently completed a Master's degree in Data Science, and I am currently progressing through Google's Machine Learning Engineer Learning Path to fortify my skills. My goal is to bring a well-rounded perspective to enterprise-level projects, leveraging the latest advancements in machine learning to drive impactful business outcomes.</p>
			<p>You might be wondering why I'm looking for a data science job when I was a perfectly competent sysadmin.  The answer is that I'm attracted to complicated rulesets and I'm tired of playing video games.  I like tinkering with and optimizing complex systems, whether it's an online game like EvE Online or a tabletop like Shadowrun. Data science, and especially machine learning, allows me to scratch the same itch with two major advantages:
			<ul>
				<li>It's more complex than any game ever conceived.  No matter how good I get, there will always be more to learn and discover.</li>
				<li>I can do it at work, which makes wasting my life away in front of a screen a lot less tempting when I have free time.</li>
			</ul>

				<p>My Master's Project compared the performance of XGBoost and RoBERTa for detecting botnet traffic.  The results were in line with what my research led me to expect, which is that XGBoost did slightly better while taking a lot less time.  My primary goal was to get more practice with both traditional and deep learning algorithms.</p>

		<h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>
		<p>I like trying new hobbies.  I'm always very into it for a few months, but most of them fall to the wayside.  The interests listed below are the ones that have 
		</p>
		<div>
			<h2>Competent Amateur</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Music</h3>
				<p>Music is my favorite hobby, and my oldest.  I enjoy playing (and sometimes composing) music, and I am comfortable with music theory. I play guitar and bass with at a reasonable level of competence, and I also sing a bit. The bass guitar has become my preferred instrument in recent years, but I still play my favorite 6-string on a regular basis.  I also dabble in mandolin and harmonica. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Cooking</h3>
				<p>I've been putting effort into cooking on and off for around 5 years now.  I like playing with food, as it's essentially chemistry that I can eat.  I want to understand the role of each ingredient in a recipe, so I can adjust it and refine it and make the dish my own. Sometimes the experimenting results in emergency pizza orders, but on the whole our diet is much tastier, healthier and cheaper than it once was.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Table Top Games</h3>
				<p>I like tabletop games because they're social.  I'm usually the host.  Depending on my guests, I'll play anything from Sorry! (the classic edition, please) to Catan to Pathfinder.  When we play long-running RPGs I'm the ForeverDM.  I don't consider myself to be the greatest game master, but I always have plenty of players.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Working On It</h2> 
				<h3>Fitness/Biohacking</h3>
				<p>I've been paying more attention to my health.  It's an addictive hobby because I'm feeling great and I want to see how far I  can take that.  Cycling, hiking and swimming are my favorite fitness activities. I have recently realized that biohacking, which is generally portrayed as rich guys doing strange things, is actually just taking a data-driven approach to my own physical and emotional well-being.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Language</h3>
				<p>I'm putting enough time into learning spanish for it to count as a hobby.  I have a 2-year streak on Duolingo and have advanced far enough that I'm now learning faster by reading along with spanish-language podcasts.  My goal is to achieve a professional level of fluency, at which point I will choose a new language to learn.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Children's Movies and Television</h3>
				<p>This was not intentional.  I restrict my children's streaming to the living room tv, because I should know what they are watching.  As I result I have seen a much larger volume of contemporary children's programming that I ever wanted to.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Former Hobbies</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Fishkeeping/Aquascaping</h3>
				<p>This is a hobby about optimizing a system for the purpose of being pleasant to look at.  I still find it interesting, but it is both expensive and upkeep intensive.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Brewing</h3>
				<p>This was the precursor to my cooking hobby.  The chemistry is more explicit and more patience is required.  The appeal of this has faded for me because I rarely drink alchohol any more.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Video Games</h3>
				<p>Each person lives for a finite number of hours. I don't need to spend any more of mine playing video games, but I will happily work with video game data if that's what your company does.
				</p> 
			</div>
			<h2>I Enjoy Reading About</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Astronomy</h3>
				<p>I have been fascinated by the cosmos since childhood.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Economics</h3>
				<p>They call it "the dismal science", but I enjoy reading about all the trade-offs and interdependencies. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Future</h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Aviation</h3>
				<p>I will be pursuing a general aviation pilot's license as soon I have the income to support the hobby.
				</p>
