						<p style="font-size:1.5em;padding-right:20px;">Hello, I'm Paul Larison. I recently completed a Master's degree in Data Science, and I am currently progressing through Google's Machine Learning Engineer Learning Path to fortify my skills. My goal is to bring a well-rounded perspective to enterprise-level projects, leveraging the latest advancements in machine learning to drive impactful business outcomes.</p>

				<h2 style="padding-top:10px;">A NEW JOURNEY</h2>
				  <tr>
					<td>
						<p style="padding:10px 20px 0;">You might be wondering why I'm looking for a data science job when I was a perfectly competent sysadmin. The short answer is that I enjoy it more. More specifically, I have learned that I'm attracted to complicated rulesets and systems, which is why I enjoy complex games and why my favorite part of system administration was designing and implementing new projects. Data science, and especially machine learning, allows me to scratch the same itch with a few major advantages:
						<ul style="padding:0px 8%;font-size:1em;">
							<li>Data science is about utilizing data to discover and find value in new knowledge. 
								<ul class="sublist"><li>System Administration is mostly the art of making disparate products made by different companies work together.</li></ul>
							<li>Data science can generate revenue for the company.  
								<ul class="sublist"><li>System administration is always overhead.</li></ul>
							<li>Data scientists must collaborate, communicate, and learn as much as possible about the business.   
								<ul class="sublist"><li>No one thinks about the sysadmins unless something breaks, which means they are incentivized to avoid notice. This means that data science is better for my emotional health.</li></ul>
							<li>Data science still has a need for The Troubleshooter, and that's me.  
								<ul class="sublist"><li> From my first teenage job at McDonald's, through my career as a sysadmin, and into grad school, I have consistently developed a reputation for successfully handling unusual problems.</li></ul>
							<li>Data science is more complex than anything I have done before.  
								<ul class="sublist"><li> This makes me feel like I'm progressing and improving as a human.</li></ul>
							<li>Data science provides tools to increase my personal understanding of the world.  
								<ul class="sublist"><li> System administrators also require continuous learning, but the new knowledge tends to be limited to in-depth information about specific computer programs.</li></ul>
							<li>Data science allows for and rewards creative solutions to the problems it poses.  
								<ul class="sublist"><li> System administration requires rigid adherence to established best practices in order to demonstrate due diligence when something inevitably goes wrong.</li></ul>
							<li>Data science can still utilize my previous experience as domain knowledge.</li>  
								<ul class="sublist"><li>I've gotten a few years out of date while pursuing my degree, but the underlying concepts haven't changed.</li></ul>

	<h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>
		<div class="boxtitle">
			<h2>Competent Amateur</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="whitebox">
			<div class="project-details">
				<h3 class="project-title">Music</h3>
				<p>Music is my favorite hobby, and my oldest.  I enjoy playing (and sometimes composing) music, and I am comfortable with music theory. I play guitar and bass with at a reasonable level of competence, and I also sing a bit. The bass guitar has become my preferred instrument in recent years, but I still play my favorite 6-string on a regular basis.  I also dabble in mandolin and harmonica. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div  class="project-details">
				<h3 class="project-title">Cooking</h3>
				<p>I've been putting effort into cooking on and off for around 5 years now.  I like playing with food, as it's essentially chemistry that I can eat.  I want to understand the role of each ingredient in a recipe, so I can adjust it and refine it and make the dish my own. Sometimes the experimenting results in emergency pizza orders, but on the whole our diet is much tastier, healthier and cheaper than it once was.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div  class="project-details">
				<h3 class="project-title">Table Top Games</h3>
				<p>I like tabletop games because they're social.  I'm usually the host.  Depending on my guests, I'll play anything from Sorry! (the classic edition, please) to Catan to Pathfinder.  When we play long-running RPGs I'm the ForeverDM.  I don't consider myself to be the greatest game master, but I always have plenty of players.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="boxtitle">
			<h2>Working On It</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="whitebox">
			<div class="project-details">
				<h3 class="project-title">Fitness/Biohacking</h3>
				<p>I've been paying more attention to my health.  It's an addictive hobby because I'm feeling great and I want to see how far I  can take that.  Cycling, hiking and swimming are my favorite fitness activities. I have recently realized that biohacking, which is generally portrayed as rich guys doing strange things, is actually just taking a data-driven approach to my own physical and emotional well-being.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-details">
				<h3 class="project-title">Language</h3>
				<p>I'm putting enough time into learning spanish for it to count as a hobby.  I have a 2-year streak on Duolingo and have advanced far enough that I'm now learning faster by reading along with spanish-language podcasts.  My goal is to achieve a professional level of fluency, at which point I will choose a new language to learn.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-details">
				<h3 class="project-title">Children's Movies and Television</h3>
				<p>This was not intentional.  I restrict my children's streaming to the living room tv, because I should know what they are watching.  As I result I have seen a much larger volume of contemporary children's programming that I ever wanted to.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="boxtitle">
			<h2>Former Hobbies</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="whitebox">
			<div class="project-details">
				<h3 class="project-title">Fishkeeping/Aquascaping</h3>
				<p>This is a hobby about optimizing a system for the purpose of being pleasant to look at.  I still find it interesting, but it is both expensive and upkeep intensive.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-details">
				<h3 class="project-title">Brewing</h3>
				<p>This was the precursor to my cooking hobby.  The chemistry is more explicit and more patience is required.  The appeal of this has faded for me because I rarely drink alchohol any more.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-details">
				<h3 class="project-title">Video Games</h3>
				<p>These are still fun, but I have decided that they consume too many life-hours without offering much in return.  I will still happily work with video game data if it's part of a job. 
				</p> 
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="boxtitle">
			<h2>Nonfiction I Enjoy</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="whitebox">
			<div class="project-details">
				<h3 class="project-title">Astronomy</h3>
				<p>I have been fascinated by the cosmos since childhood, and astronomy is heavily featured in my news feed.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project-details">
				<h3 class="project-title">Economics</h3>
				<p>They call it "the dismal science", but I enjoy reading about all the trade-offs and interdependencies.  I'd like to find more time to do my own analysis of economic data, as economists frequently disagree with each other. 
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="boxtitle">
			<h2>Future Goal</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="whitebox">
			<div class="project-details">
				<h3 class="project-title">Aviation</h3>
				<p>I will be pursuing a general aviation pilot's license as soon I have the income to support the hobby.
